Plan for this session:

1. [Importing Data and Building a Network](#part1) 
2. [Exploring Network](#part2) 
    * [Network as a whole](#part21) 
    * [Network communities](#part22) 
    * [Network actors](#part23) 
    
3. [Exporting the Network](#part3) 

The network we are going to build is based on a relationship studied in this paper:

<img src="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/CTforGA_Networks/raw/main/paper.png" width="900">


In that paper, the researcher builds a matrix of relationships like this:

<img src="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/CTforGA_Networks/raw/main/dataRed.png" width="900">

<a id='part1'></a>

## 1. Importing Data

The data was not available from the author's website, so the matrix you see above was copied and pasted to Excel:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# opening excel
library(rio)

linkAdjMx='https://github.com/EvansDataScience/CTforGA_Networks/raw/main/dataFigueroa.xlsx'

adjacency=import(linkAdjMx,which = 1)
```

This data is organized as an adjacency matrix. It should be squared:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
dim(adjacency)
```

Let's take a look:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
head(adjacency)
```

Let's move the column _Names_ as the  row names, then we will get an squared matrix:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
row.names(adjacency)=adjacency$Names
adjacency$Names=NULL

# then
head(adjacency)
```



This matrix is saved as a _data frame_ has now to be converted into a **matrix**.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
adjacency=as.matrix(adjacency) # This coerces the object into a matrix, just in case


```


From this kind of structure (the adjacency _matrix_), we can easily create a network via **Igraph**:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
EliteNet=graph.adjacency(adjacency,mode="undirected",weighted=NULL)
# see it here
EliteNet
```

A network is composed of _nodes_ (aka vertices) and _edges_ that connect them. You can know how many you have of each like this:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
vcount(EliteNet) #count of nodes
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ecount(EliteNet) #count of edges
```



You can take a look at how this network looks like:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
plot.igraph(EliteNet,
            vertex.color = 'yellow',
            edge.color='lightblue')
```

So far we only have nodes and their links. Let's bring som information about the nodes:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# The adjacency matrix did not include the nodes attributes.
attributes=import(linkAdjMx,which = 2)
head(attributes)

```


Igraph can add an attribute easily. Let's proceed with the change:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
EliteNet=set_vertex_attr(EliteNet,"multi",value=attributes$multinational)

#then
EliteNet
```

It should have worked:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
vertex_attr_names(EliteNet) 
```

Before going further, it is good to know if our network is connected:


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
is_connected(EliteNet)
```

So we have these people in components, how many?
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
components(EliteNet)$no
```

What nodes are in each component?:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
groups(components(EliteNet))
```

Let me add the component as an attribute:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
component=components(EliteNet)$membership
EliteNet=set_vertex_attr(EliteNet,"component",value=component)
#then
EliteNet
```


A visual representation follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
Labels=component
numberOfClasses = length(unique(Labels)) 

#preparing color
library(RColorBrewer)
colorForScale='Set2'
colors = brewer.pal(numberOfClasses, colorForScale)

# plotting
plot.igraph(EliteNet,
             vertex.color = colors[Labels],
             edge.color='lightblue')
```

As we do not have ONE connected network but several components, we can pay attention to the Giant Component (component with max nodes), follow these steps:

1. Get the sizes of each component:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
(Sizes=components(EliteNet)$csize)
```

2. Get the subnet with the largest component:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# this is a subnet
EliteNet_giant=induced.subgraph(EliteNet, which(Labels == which.max(Sizes)))
```



Let's take a look at the Giant Component:


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
plot.igraph(EliteNet_giant)
```

Basic summary:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
summary(EliteNet_giant)
```


We will use the giant component as our network to be explored.

## 2. Exploring the NETWORK


<a id='part21'></a>

### Exploring the Network as a whole


* Density: from 0 to 1, where 1 makes it a 'complete' network: there is a link between every pair of nodes.

<center><img src="https://cdn.fs.guides.co/PDn0ImTfSb6QwgIvdoQ8" width="500"></center>

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
graph.density(EliteNet_giant)
```

* Diameter: worst case escenario for number of steps for someone to contact another one (only for connected component).

<center><img src="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/CTforGA_Networks/raw/main/diameter.jpeg" width="500"></center>


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
diameter(EliteNet_giant)
```


* Local clustering coefficient of a node is away to measure the level of connectivity its neighbors. If all its neighbors are connected among one another you get 1; if none of them is connected you get zero. Then, the average clustering coefficient tells you the average of those values.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# we need some help beyond Igraph:
transitivity(EliteNet_giant,type = 'average')
```

* Shortest path (average): it gets the average of every shortest path among the nodes in the network. A shorter path is the shortest _walk_ from one node to another.


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
average.path.length(EliteNet_giant)
```

**Random networks** have *small shortest path* and *small clustering coefficient*...Is this the case?. The high clustering coefficient would suggest a **small world**, as most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but most nodes can be reached from every other in few steps.


<center><img src="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/CTforGA_Networks/raw/main/networkTypes.jpeg" width="500"></center>



* Transitivity: How probable is that two business men with a common business friend, are also friends.


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
transitivity(EliteNet_giant)
```

* Assortativity (degree): it is a measure to see if nodes are connecting to other nodes similar in degree.  Closer to 1 means higher assortativity, closer to -1 diassortativity; while 0 is no assortitivity.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
assortativity_degree(EliteNet_giant)
```

You can also compute assortativity using an attribute of interest:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
attrNet=V(EliteNet_giant)$multi
assortativity(EliteNet_giant,attrNet)
```

Coloring by attribute:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
LabelsColor=attrNet+1
colors=c('lightblue','magenta')
plot.igraph(EliteNet_giant,
       vertex.color = colors[LabelsColor])
```

### Exploration of network communities

A **clique** can be understood a community of nodes where all of them are connected to one another.

* How many cliques can be found in this network?

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
length(cliques(EliteNet_giant))
```

If a clique in the network can not be bigger is you add another node, then you have a **maximal clique**.

<center><img src="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/CTforGA_Networks/raw/main/cliqueMaximal.png" width="500"></center>



* How many maximal cliques are there in this network?
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# How many cliques
count_max_cliques(EliteNet_giant)
```

You can find the size of the _maximum cliques_:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
clique_num(EliteNet_giant)
```


You can see each maximum clique like this:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
max_cliques(EliteNet_giant,min=8)
```

If a network presents cliques makes you suspect that there can be **communities**.

This is a huge field of research, let me me show you one of the algorithms known as the [_Louvain method_](https://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.blondel/research/louvain.html).


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
communities=cluster_louvain(EliteNet_giant)
(partition=membership(communities))
```



Now, use those values to make a plot to highlight the communities:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
Labels=partition
numberOfClasses = length(unique(Labels)) 

library(RColorBrewer)
colorForScale='Set2'
colors = brewer.pal(numberOfClasses, colorForScale)

plot.igraph(EliteNet_giant,
             vertex.color = colors[Labels],
             edge.color='lightblue')
```

Let's turn our attention to the nodes and their roles in the network.

<a id='part23'></a>

### Exploration of network actors


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
rounding=3
degr=round(degree(EliteNet_giant,,normalized=T),rounding)
close=round(closeness(EliteNet_giant,,normalized=T),rounding)
betw=round(betweenness(EliteNet_giant,,normalized=T),rounding)

DFCentrality=as.data.frame(cbind(degr,close,betw),stringsAsFactors = F)
names(DFCentrality)=c('Degree','Closeness','Betweenness')
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
DFCentrality$person=row.names(DFCentrality)
row.names(DFCentrality)=NULL
head(DFCentrality)
```


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(DFCentrality, aes(x=Betweenness, y=Closeness)) + theme_classic()+
  scale_size(range = c(1, 25))  + geom_text(aes(label=person,color=Degree)) +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "orange", high = "black")
```

The node with the highest degree could be considered a _hub_ in the network:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
DFCentrality[which.max(DFCentrality$Degree),]
```


We can plot the neighbors of the hub, _its ego network_:

1. Determine the hub name:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#who
hub=DFCentrality[which.max(DFCentrality$Degree),]$person
```
2. Determine the hub position:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#where (a character to numeric)
hubix=as.numeric(row.names(DFCentrality[which.max(DFCentrality$Degree),]))
```
3. Request the ego network of the hub:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
HubEgonets=make_ego_graph(EliteNet_giant, nodes=hubix)
# HubEgonets is a list, get the first one:
HubEgonet=HubEgonets[[1]]
```

4. Just plot the ego you got:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
egoSizes=rep(5,vcount(HubEgonet)) # sizes '5' for every node
egoSizes[hubix]=40  # size '40' for this one
V(HubEgonet)$size=egoSizes # saving sizes
plot.igraph(HubEgonet,
             vertex.color = 'yellow',
             edge.color='lightblue')
```

Can this network be disconnected? 
If so, we can compute the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect the network (create at least two components):

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
vertex_connectivity(EliteNet_giant)
```


Who is the sole node with the power to break the network?

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
(cut=articulation_points(EliteNet_giant))
```

We can highlight the _articulation node_ in the giant component:


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
cutix=which(V(EliteNet_giant)==cut)

allSizes=rep(10,vcount(EliteNet_giant))
allSizes[cutix]=40
V(EliteNet_giant)$size=allSizes # saving sizes
plot.igraph(EliteNet_giant,
             vertex.color = 'yellow',
             edge.color='lightblue',vertex.shape='sphere')
```

## Exporting the network



```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
write_graph(EliteNet, "EliteNetR.graphml", "graphml")
```
